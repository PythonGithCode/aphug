women may work at land but they will usually not own the land they are working on.
It will be owned by men and some women cant even own their own land do to laws which makes it difficult for women to make good decisions about the land they farm on.


A lot of the problems stem from gender bias and how women are treated unfairly then how men are.
Where a man would rather talk to another man then to a women.


Women can not get the capital they need to make adequate yields. As they can't get the money they need for fertilizers, drought resistance seeds and many other thing that the male counter part can do freely.
If women were allowed to take out the capital they would need then they would be able to allow for the abundance of food for others and save millions of lives. But to do this there need to be a way to get rid of the social bias.


There have been efforts by the sponsor of [[National Geographic]], [[PepsiCo Foundation]]. To allow for women to have the same abilities to shrink the [[Crop Gap]]. 


This is why we need to shrink the gender gap it would help millions of people world wide. To do this governments need to stop the gender bias and allow women to the same access as men have.
