# The [[ap-hug/Funit 4/United Nations|United Nations]]

The [[ap-hug/Funit 4/United Nations|United Nations]] was ==organized in 1945 with 51 original members==, including 49 sovereign states plus Byelorussia (now Belarus) and Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. ==The number of U.N. members reached 193 in 2011== ([Figure 8-32](https://plus.pearson.com/courses/skari77882/products/1GO0LA0N460/pages/ch08_pg0004.xhtml#P7001015673000000000000000003A98)). The U.N. ==membership has increased rapidly on three occasions==:

- 1955, ==Sixteen countries joined in 1955==, mostly European countries that had been liberated from Nazi Germany during World War II.
    
- 1960, ==Seventeen new members were added in 1960==, all but one a former African colony of Britain or France. Only four African states were original members of the [[ap-hug/Funit 4/United Nations|United Nations]]—Egypt, Ethiopia, Liberia, and South Africa—and only six more joined during the 1950s.
    
- 1990–1993, ==Twenty-six countries were added between 1990 and 1993==, primarily due to the breakup of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. U.N. membership also increased in the 1990s because of the admission of several microstates.

The [[ap-hug/Funit 4/United Nations|United Nations]] was ==not the world’s first attempt at international peacemaking==. The U.N. replaced an earlier organization known as the League of Nations, which was established after World War I. ==The League of Nations was never an effective peacekeeping organization==. ==The United States did not join it, despite the fact that President Woodrow Wilson initiated the idea==, because the U.S. Senate refused to ratify the membership treaty. By the 1930s, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Soviet Union had all withdrawn, and the League of Nations could not stop aggression by these states against neighboring countries.

On occasion, the ==U.N. has intervened in conflicts between or within member states==, authorizing military and peacekeeping actions. U.N. members can vote to establish a peacekeeping force and request that states contribute military forces ([Figure 8-33](https://plus.pearson.com/courses/skari77882/products/1GO0LA0N460/pages/ch08_pg0004.xhtml#P7001015673000000000000000003AA8)). ==The U.N. is playing an important role in trying to separate warring groups ==in a number of regions, especially in ==Eastern Europe, Central and Southwest Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa.==

Because it ==must rely on individual countries to supply troops, the U.N. often lacks enough of them to keep peace effectively.== The U.N==. tries to maintain strict neutrality in separating warring factions,== but this has proved difficult in places such as Bosnia & Herzegovina, where most of the world sees two ethnicities (Bosnia’s Serbs and Croats) as aggressors undertaking ethnic cleansing against weaker victims (Bosniaks), as discussed in [Chapter 7](https://plus.pearson.com/courses/skari77882/products/1GO0LA0N460/pages/ch07_pg0001.xhtml#P70010156730000000000000000031E5).

However, ==any one of the five permanent members of the Security Council—China, France, Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), the United Kingdom, and the United States—can veto a peacekeeping operation.== During the Cold War era, the United States and the Soviet Union used the veto to prevent undesired U.N. intervention, and it was only ==after the Soviet Union’s delegate walked out of a Security Council meeting in 1950 that the U.N. voted to send troops to support South Korea.== More recently, the opposition of ==China and Russia has made it difficult for the international community to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.==

Despite its shortcomings, though, ==the U.N. represents a forum where, during this era of rapid changes in states and their relationships, for the first time in history virtually all states of the world can meet and vote on issues without resorting to war.== More importantly, ==the U.N. has played a major role in the promotion of international cooperation to address global economic problems, promote human rights, and provide humanitarian relief.==
