Countries work together to achieve economies of scale (savings in cost by increasing production)

Countries working together have a common set of regulations and laws and lower tariffs than when they work alone. 

Countries working together can trade more freely both within their trade zone and outside their trade zone. 

Countries working together can specialize in certain sectors of the economy such as manufacturing, technology, or natural resources.
