**Countries that join a supranationalist organization may have to cede some sovereignty to the organization. 

Examples: 

-Most EU members have given up control of their own currency to participate in the Eurozone. 

-Article 5 of the NATO Charter says, “an attack on one is an attack on all.” If a NATO country is attacked all countries must contribute to its defense, if asked.**
