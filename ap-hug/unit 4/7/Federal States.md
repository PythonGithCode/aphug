Federal states have a decentralized government structure.
- Power is shared between a national assembly inside a national capital city and local assemblies inside local capital cities.

Federal governments share political power with lower levels of governments 
- Central government makes some laws, but most laws are passed at the state level. 
- Laws and policies differ between jurisdictions
- Central governments cannot create or abolish local government units
- Local governments provide most public services (public schools, fire departments, police)
