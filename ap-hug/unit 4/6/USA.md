USA has a congressional body- the House of Representatives (great example!)

The House is based on the population of each state, so the larger a state’s population is, the more representatives it has in the House. 

The US Census is conducted every 10 years to count the population of states, among other things, which allows us to reapportion how many representatives in the House there are per state.


Each state then redistricts its political boundaries to establish voting districts for both the HoR and the its own state government. 

State legislatures draw new districts, which means that the party in majority power in the legislature has an advantage to draw districts in their party’s favor. 

Therefore, state legislatures often gerrymander districts to ensure their advantage.
