##### [About Us](https://www.un.org/en/about-us) 
One place where the world's nations can  
gather together, discuss common problems  
and find shared solutions.

The [[ap-hug/Funit 4/United Nations|United Nations]] is an international organization founded in 1945. Currently made up of 193 [Member States](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/member-states), the [UN and its work](https://www.un.org/en/our-work) are guided by the purposes and principles contained in its founding [Charter](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter).

The UN has evolved over the years to keep pace with a rapidly changing world.

But one thing has stayed the same: it remains the one place on Earth where all the world’s nations can gather together, discuss common problems, and find shared solutions that benefit all of humanity.
