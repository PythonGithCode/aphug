Some terrorist incidents, such as the Oklahoma City and Orlando attacks.

Most recent attacks, however, have been carried out by members belonging to terrorist organizations. Prominent terrorist organizations in recent years include al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, and Boko Haram, as well as the Taliban

#### Al-Qaeda
Responsible for the 2001 World Trade Center attack was Al-Qaeda (an Arabic word meaning “the foundation,” or “the base”). The terrorist organization was founded around 1988 by Osama bin Laden to unite several groups of fighters in Afghanistan as well as his supporters elsewhere in Southwest Asia.

used his several-hundred million-dollar inheritance to fund al-Qaeda.

Bin Laden moved to Afghanistan during the mid-1980s to support the fight against the Soviet army and the country’s Soviet-installed government.

After the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia, but he was expelled in 1991 for opposing the Saudi government’s decision permitting the United States to station troops there during the 1991 war against Iraq.

Bin Laden issued a declaration of war against the United States in 1996 because of U.S. support for Saudi Arabia and Israel. In a 1998 fatwa (“religious decree”), bin Laden argued that Muslims have a duty to wage a holy war against U.S. citizens because the United States was responsible for protecting the State of Israel and for maintaining the Saud royal family as rulers of Saudi Arabia. He claimed that destruction of the Saudi monarchy and the Jewish state would liberate from their control Islam’s three holiest sites of Makkah (Mecca), Madinah, and Jerusalem.

Al-Qaeda’s most deadly attacks since 9/11 have been in Iraq, especially between 2007 and 2011. Its most notorious terrorist attack was a 2015 attack at the Paris offices of the French satirical newspaper _Charlie Hebdo_. Two members of an al-Qaeda branch based in Yemen killed 11 people in the office and 6 more elsewhere in Paris, and injured 22. The attackers were protesting cartoons depicting Muhammad in the newspaper, a practice considered taboo in Islam. Several cartoonists were among the victims.

Al-Qaeda is not a single unified organization, especially since U.S. forces tracked down and killed bin Laden in 2011. Instead, it adapted a decentralized structure with loosely associated so-called franchises that are ideologically aligned with al-Qaeda’s goals but not financially tied to it.
