The scale of [[ethnic cleansing]] in Europe during World War II has not been repeated, but [[ethnic cleansing]] has occurred more recently in Europe in the Balkans.

Most profoundly for the rest of the world, the incident that sparked World War I occurred in the Balkans. In June 1914, the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary was assassinated in Sarajevo by a Serb who sought independence for Bosnia.

After World War I, the Allies created a new country, Yugoslavia, to unite several Balkan ethnicities that spoke similar South Slavic languages.

Individuals from the five most numerous ethnicities—Croat, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serb, and Slovene—were allowed to exercise considerable control over the areas they inhabited within Yugoslavia.

Rivalries among ethnicities resurfaced in Yugoslavia during the 1980s after Tito’s death, leading ultimately to its breakup into several small countries. Because the boundaries of the new countries did not match the distribution of ethnicities, the breakup of Yugoslavia did not happen peacefully. Several episodes of [[ethnic cleansing]] ensued.

At the time of the breakup of Yugoslavia, 82 percent of the population of Kosovo were ethnic Albanians and 10 percent were Serbs. Kosovo was controlled by Serbia. Serbia had a historical claim to Kosovo, having controlled it between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries. Serbs fought an important—though losing—battle in Kosovo against the Ottoman Empire in 1389. In recognition of its role in forming the Serb ethnicity, Serbia was given control of Kosovo when Yugoslavia was created in the early twentieth century.

With the breakup of Yugoslavia, Serbia took direct control of Kosovo and launched a campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Albanian majority.

Serb [[ethnic cleansing]] forced more than 800,000 of Kosovo’s 2 million ethnic Albanian

Outraged by the [[ethnic cleansing]], the United States and Western European countries, operating through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), launched an air attack against Serbia. The bombing campaign ended when Serbia agreed to withdraw all of its soldiers and police from Kosovo.

Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. Around 115 countries, including the United States, recognize Kosovo as an independent country, but Serbia, Russia, China, and their allies oppose it. However, the declaration of independence induced nearly 90 percent of the country’s Serbs to leave.
