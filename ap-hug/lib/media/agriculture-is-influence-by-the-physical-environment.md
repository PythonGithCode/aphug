1. All plants have certain requirements: 
2. ==Space==: suitable room to grow or they will have to compete for resources with other plants.    
3. ==Light==: sufficient light to perform photosynthesis  
4. ==Water==: to help absorb nutrients  
5. ==Nutrients==: nourishment - phosphate & nitrogen   
6. ==Suitable temperature==: growth 

The types of crops grown will vary according climatic factors and physical geography.

Humans can supplement some plants’ needs to make up deficiencies. 


Human Modification Types: 
- ==Space==: clearing more land or modifying land so crops have ==more room==. 
- ==Light==: humans can provide artificial grow lights to ==aid photosynthesis==.
- ==Water==: Humans can ==irrigate crops== if the water supply is deficient or ==sporadic==
- ==Nutrients==: Humans use [[fertilizers]] to nourish plants so they can ==grow quickly==. 
- ==Suitable temperature==: Humans grow crops in [[greenhouses]] and other buildings to maintain a ==constant temperature==.
