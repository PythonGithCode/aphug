## **Unit 3: Culture Patterns and Processes** 

### **Step 1: Create your Unit 3 Page** 

Answer the questions below about your country on your webpage. **Each answer should be written in complete sentences using a sufficient amount of detail.** Each answer should also have a visual to go with it. This visual can be a map, image, table, chart, graph, or other visual aid. For images, [wikimedia commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) are great sources of images that are free for use without copyright concerns.

1\. Compare **Local (folk) and Global (pop) culture** (use your textbook, chapter 4 as a reference). Describe an example of local culture in your country, and provide an image or video. Describe an example of the influence of global culture in your country, and provide an image or video. 




2\. Identify which **language(s)** is/are most commonly spoken in your country. Include a YouTube video of your language(s) being spoken. Also include a chart or diagram showing which languages are spoken in your country. Then: 
  
  a. **Define language family, branch, group, and dialect**. Identify the family, branch, group, and dialect for the most common language spoken in your country. (Use the language tree in chapter 5 of your textbook as a reference). 

  b. Describe the specific **type of diffusion** that brought various languages to your country (use the Encyclopedia Britannica as a reference, look up the language).

  c. Define **lingua franca**, and discuss whether or not a common lingua franca is used in your country. 





3\. Identify which **religion(s**) is/are most commonly practiced in your country. Include a YouTube video summarizing the beliefs/history of that religion(s). (A series called ‘belief’ from the Oprah Winfrey Network might be a good place to start, as well as Crash Course World History, or The School of Life YouTube Channel). Also include a chart or diagram of which religions are practiced in your country. Then: 

  a. Define **universalizing and ethnic religion** (use your textbook chapter 6 as a reference). Identify whether the religion(s) in your country is ethnic or universalizing. If universalizing, describe the diffusion of the religion to or from your country (or both).

  b. Summarize the beliefs of different branches of the religion(s) in your country.



**Step 2: Cite your Sources** 

For each question, make sure you inform your reader where you found your information. We will use a citation style called MLA style for this class, because it is the standard citation style you will need most often in high school. **_You must use the textbook as one of your sources._**

You need two things: 

1\. Every question should have what is called a parenthetical citation in it. Basically, you tell your reader what source you used by putting the author’s name or title of the article in parentheses. Your reader then looks at the list of your sources to see where you got that information. 

2\. You need a list of sources called a “Works Cited” at the bottom of each of your webpages. Each source you used — whether it’s a webpage or a page from a book or encyclopedia — is listed here. The format is very important! We will learn how to cite sources in class. For help and reference, you can use the links below:
