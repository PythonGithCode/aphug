==Poor infrastructure in developing countries makes it hard to get food crops to the [[market]].== 


- ==Farmers in developing countries== often do not have access to roads or other forms of transportation to move their crops to markets. 
    
- Most transportation routes connect farmers to ports for export. 
    
- Farmers grow luxury items because they can export them easily. 
    

==Farmers in developed countries== can ship their food products cheaply across the world. 

- Crops from developed countries are often more plentiful and cheaper to buy than local crops in developing countries (Why???)
