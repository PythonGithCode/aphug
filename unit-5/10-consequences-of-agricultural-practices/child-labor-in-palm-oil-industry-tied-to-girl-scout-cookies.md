There are two different girls who one is harvesting palm oil, and the other is selling Girl scout cookies.

Where there is labor that is under the 18 where there are lots of young children. That are working there, and that there are people who have built their family's in the palm oil business. They don't have houses that aren't very livable where the house's are dilapidated shack's.

Used for everything many different things.
