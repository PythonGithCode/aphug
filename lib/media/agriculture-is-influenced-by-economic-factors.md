Farmers must decide what and how to farm based on financial considerations. 

Cost of the land: expensive land means the farmer cannot afford as much land and must generate sufficient revenue to make money off of the land. 

- Quarter Section = 160 acres
- One Section is 1 mile by 1 mile
- $6,000 / acre of tillable land
    

Cost of labor: high costs of labor or the need for  a lot of farmer workers drives up costs and makes it necessary to generate higher revenue. 


Cost of Machinery: high initial investment but can save money in the long run. (new combine can cost anywhere from $330k to $500k)
