[[Hybridization]] and [[GMO]]s resulted in higher yields

  

==[[Hybrid plants]] are bred to have superior characteristics== 
  Ex) IR35 became the most planted strain of rice in the world
\	 - Resistant to various types of insects
\	 - ==Short growing season allows for [[double cropping]]==

  
[[GMO]]s change the [[gene]] of the [[plant]]
- Allows plants to have characteristics they can’t get through [[hybridization]]
- [[Corn]], [[soybeans]], [[cotton]] - resistant to pesticides
